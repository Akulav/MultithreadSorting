# MultithreadSorting
Multithreaded merge sort.
Inside the code "N" is the number of random generated numbers.
The "getchar()" and the end are just to keep the console windows from closing.
The "merge_sort_mt(start, len, 4);" is the line that defines the number of threads. The third attribute, in this case "4" means 4 threads.
